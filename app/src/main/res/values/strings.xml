    <string name="read_help_desc">To read a tag in this app,
        encrypted data must have already be written into the tag,
        an empty tag or a tag with only text records written in it.\n
        Any other kind of data written on the tag can not be read by this app,
        as this app is not designed to read all types.\n
        Make sure to have NFC turned on in the device\'s settings before continuing with the help guide.\n
        To read the contents of a tag, simply scan the tag by placing it near the device.
        (for more information on where is the NFC reader on this device, please refer to the device\'s manual or google it).\n
        A password prompt will come up if encrypted data was written previously into tag otherwise
        it will simply show the records in the order they we were written into it.

    <string name="write_help_desc">To write and encrypt data into an NFC tag, 2 perquisites are required:\n
        1: A device that supports NFC tag reading and writing.(This should already be achieved as the app can not be installed otherwise).\n
        2: An NFC tag that supports NDEF technology(check the seller of the tag for more information).\n\n
        On the WRITE tab records (texts) can be added and both a password and a confirmation are required to encrypt that data into the tag.\n
